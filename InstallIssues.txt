Installation issues for this app is no longer a concern, since the end product now is a web application.
However, it may still be needed on a new development computer.  Keep in mind that this refers to the
  running application, NOT the development code.

The 'installation' is a manual process:
1.  Copy the dev env to "C:\Program Files", keeping the folder name:  'Memory Bank'.
2.  Copy C:\Jars to the new computer  (external libraries like for logging)
3.  Remove the subdirectory 'appData'
4.  Refresh / update as desired from current dev effort, by running the 'make' and 'pub'
    scripts from the 'scripts' folder.
5.  Run the app from desktop shortcuts with these specs:
    A.  The 'run-only' shortcut:
        Target:    "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_192\bin\javaw.exe" -classpath mbank.jar;c:\jars\* MemoryBank  (plus an email)
        Start in:   "\Program Files\Memory Bank"
        Run:        Minimized
    B.  The 'debug' shortcut:
        Target:    "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_192\bin\java.exe" -Dtiming -Ddebug -classpath mbank.jar;c:\jars\* MemoryBank lee@doughmain.net
        Start in:   "\Program Files\Memory Bank"
        Run:        Normal Window


Need to put a 'swing.properties' file into the lib folder of the JVM:
(complete file is below, between the '==' lines)

Update 6/6/2018: It appears that since jdk1.8, the above addition is built-in and no longer needs to be
explicitly added in order to use that L&F.  Rediscovered this today, upon installing jdk10.
