This is just a test area in the same, default package so that it can use classes from the main app.

Where those classes previously had a 'main', the main was removed from them and recreated here,
as a mechanism to continue allow running them stand-alone while improving test coverage percentages.

Disable this area prior to running tests to collect coverage.
