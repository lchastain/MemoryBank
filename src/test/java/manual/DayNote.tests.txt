 Behavioral Tests:
------------------------------------------------------------
Compile / run with the debug printing activated.
For each test activity, verify that the debug printing
  shows that the correct methods are being called,
  in the correct order, the correct number of times.
Bring up DayNotes (standalone, not part of Log)

 Test Case A: Note Addition
 1.  Add notes until interface is full, by typing a
     key and then pressing the DOWN key, alternately,
     until the scrollbar appears and two or more notes
     are outside the scroll view.
 2.  Verify that the scrollbar scrolls as needed, and
     focus wraps around as needed when keyboard
     navigation is used, and that keyboard navigation
     works as expected (as well as mouse navigation).

 Test Case B: Popup menu for the Text Field
 1.  Right-click in a text field that is two or more
     notes distant from the current focus.  Verify that
     the popup menu appears.  Repeat this step using
     different notes.
 2.  Left-click on a note and make sure that the popup
     goes away and focus changes to the note you clicked.
 3.  Bring up the popup menu, then use UP/DOWN arrows to
     navigate to the next field.  Verify menu goes away.


 Test Case C: Time Format Toggle
 1.  Enter six notes for the day
 2.  Clear the time on one note.
 3.  Clear entire note on another note.
 4.  Toggle format, observe expected behavior.
 5.  Continue entering notes until max is reached,
     repeat the above tests.
 6.  Verify correct operation for last note whether it 
     has been cleared or not.
 7.  Verify that a cleared time can be saved and restored.


 Test Case D: Icon
 1.  Clear the Icon, Set as default, verify on same day plus a 
     previously saved day.

 Test Case E: Consistent Look & Feel
 There is a large visual difference in the scrollbar between the
 Windows L&F and the one provided by default.  This test case is
 needed to ensure that all interfaces are consistent.
 1.  Add notes until the scrollbar appears.  Verify it is gray.
       (vs a mottled blue)
 2.  Call up the popup menus, verify blue when selected 
       (vs light blue)
 3.  Call up the Icon selector, check the scrollbar there.
 4.  Call up an extended note, look at the Subject selector.
