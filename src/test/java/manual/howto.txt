One-stop reference for how tests are getting things done.

0.  Make / get rich test data:  This is done by using the app to make the data you want, then copy that
    entire user data collection into Test Resources.  The setup for each class can clear out existing
    data and reestablish it from the resources.  See AppTreePanelTest setup.  There can be different
    test user data sources (like jondo) but the chosen one gets copied to test.user@lcware.net.

1.  Select a node on the main app 'tree':  instantiate an AppTreePanel, get its JTree with .getTree(), call
    setSelectionPath or setSelectionRow on it.  Lower-level requirements are listed separately, further on.

2.  Get the TreePath to a node with a known name/text:  see the testCloseSearchResult test in the
    AppTreePanelTest class - it does that (in several steps and external static methods).

3.  Get the TodoNoteGroup for a given list:  With the list name (essentially the file name) known, the
    group may simply be constructed directly; no need to go to the JTree for it.  The constructor
    loads the file into the group's components.



Get a TodoNoteGroup from the tree:  hadn't yet figured this out...


Get a TodoNoteComponent:  call getNoteComponent on the TodoNoteGroup instance.  Parameter needed is the zero-based index
number into the group.
