This is just a test area in the same, default package so that it can use classes from the main app.

Where some classes previously had a 'main', the main was removed from them and recreated here,
as a mechanism to continue allow running them stand-alone while improving test coverage percentages.

Use the context menu of the 'java' directory - 'Mark Directory as' :
  'Test Sources Root', to enable / run the classes here without affecting coverage.
