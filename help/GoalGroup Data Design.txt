A GoalGroupPanel extends a NoteGroupPanel.

GoalGroupPanel data:   (collected in the GoalGroupPanel, not held as a discrete Class)
====================================================================

Short name -
    The text as seen in the selectable leaf of the App tree.  May or may not resemble the goalTitle.
    This is not a class member; it is just the filename of the data file that it has as a descendant
        of FileGroup (the portion of the text of the full filename that comes after 'goal_' and before '.json')

GoalGroupProperties:
        noteId - (inherited from BaseData) Populated at creation of the GoalGroupPanel and Properties.
            It is a UUID for the Goal.  It will be put into a Linkage of a NoteData item that points to this
            goal, and will dereference the name of the goal from its unique identifier, allowing
            for renaming of a Goal while not breaking the linkage of any Note that points to it.
        Last Mod Date (inherited from BaseData) - updated when title, status, or the plan changes.
        goalTitle - single line of text beyond the Short name, descriptive of the goal
                in the 'Title' area of the GoalGroupPanel.
                Should also be descriptive of the goal, if possible in 1-3 words
        goalPlan - The plan - textual description of what needs to be done.
        Status      <this one is still a work in progress, while now starting on the GoalNoteComponent>
            Overall
                on track, ahead, behind
            At the Moment
                stalled
                working
                waiting
                other?

The untyped Vector (groupDataVector) that is inherited from NoteGroupPanel.
    Every LinkData that points to this goal (in the right order).
    The GoalGroupPanel will fill the Vector and set its content type to <LinkData>.
    See LinkData.java for more on Vector element makeup.
