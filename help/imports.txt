Did a test of exporting Outlook contacts in a CSV format, to see what it would look like, and how easy would it be to
pull it in to a new feature for Memory Bank.

The MB app does not yet have a 'People' category but if it did then it could have a set of fields to which many of
the ones in the export file would need to be mapped, and then this could work.

Then other exportable apps would also need mapping, or provide a user interface to allow them to define their own
import mappings.

Maybe the import UI would show a proposed mapping but allow for user changes prior to actually doing it.
