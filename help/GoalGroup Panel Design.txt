==========================================================================================================
Not yet handled:

During a merge - two identical todo items but one is linked, another is not.
they would have different IDs...

A linked todo item is moved to a DayNote, or copied somewhere.

If the goal goes away...
if a linked list or item goes away - update the goal with the note that it went away.
The update may not happen until the goal checks on the linkage, possibly with an 'update'
button.

Link status choices same as Goal statuses?
