This doc is needed in order to set down the expected behaviors of panels with respect to dates.


There are five date-related Panels to consider, where a date is shown:
    Day Notes
    Month Notes
    Year Notes
    Month View
    Year View

And the AppTreePanel coordinates date changes by maintaining a 'viewedDate' tracking variable that is a LocalDate
that is initialized to 'now()' upon session start.

All date-related panels, both the Notes and the Views, should be showing the viewedDate, that is set on them
by AppTreePanel prior to their display.

When a Panel does not have a date granularity down to the level of the specific day of the viewedDate, it still uses
that date to show its content because the viewedDate will include the time period that the panel needs to display.

Only 'View' panels have a selected date concept, and that setting comes from the View panel itself, upon mouse-click
on the specific day to be selected.  There is no requirement that the selection on the YearView be the same as the
selection on the MonthView, and neither selection has an effect on AppTreePanel's viewedDate, but logically that date
would already be within the same Month & Year since no selection is possible unless the date to be selected is also
already visible on the Panel.  Selected dates will default to current date, and upon a change will have no effect on
any other panel.  But there IS an exception - when the selection is made by a double-click on a specific date, the
AppTreePanel's viewedDate WILL change to that date (a delta of no more than 31 days).

The change of the viewedDate on any one panel will reflect back to AppTreePanel and therefore will have the same effect
on all other date-related panels (not an immediate effect, but when they are viewed).

All five panels can alter the AppTreePanel's Viewed Date via the arrow controls or the 'T' button in their header.
The 'T' button is a shortcut to setting the panel to 'Today' (it sets the viewedDate to LocalDate.now).

The 'Today' main menu item does not alter the Viewed Date; it is a simple textual display of the current date.

Test Plan:

1.  Start the app (AppTreePanel)
    Show each of the five date-related panels and verify that their dates are the same, 'today'.

2.  Set a known viewed date in the AppTreePanel, then show each panel and verify its shown date.
