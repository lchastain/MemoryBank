This doc is needed in order to set down the expected behaviors of panels with respect to dates.


There are five date-related Panels to consider, where a date is shown:
    Day Notes
    Month Notes
    Year Notes
    Month View
    Year View

And the AppTreePanel coordinates date changes between constructed and unconstructed Panels by maintaining a LocalDate
tracking variable (viewedDate) that is initialized to 'now()' upon session start.  After that, whichever panel is being
displayed has the ability to change its own date and that will set a new viewedDate in the AppTreePanel.  Then when any
other date-related Panel is constructed, it will show its content based on the viewedDate from the AppTreePanel.

When a Panel does not have a date granularity down to the level of the specific day of the viewedDate, it still uses
that date to show its content because the viewedDate will cover the time period that the panel needs to display.

All five panels can alter their own date via the arrow controls or the 'T' button in their header.
The 'T' button invokes LocalDate.now() as a shortcut to setting the panel to 'Today'.  Note that the 'Today' main menu
item does not alter the Date; it simply results in a large textual display of the current date.

Only 'View' type panels have a selected date concept, and that setting comes from the panel itself, upon mouse-click
on the specific day to be selected.  There is no requirement that the selection on the YearView be the same as the
selection on the MonthView, and neither selection has an effect on AppTreePanel's viewedDate, but logically that date
would already be within the same Month & Year since no selection is possible unless the date to be selected is also
already visible on the Panel.  Selected dates will default to current date, and upon a change will have no effect on
any other panel.  But there IS an exception - when the selection is made by a double-click on a specific date, the
AppTreePanel's viewedDate WILL change to that date and the view will change to DayNotes.



===================================================================================================================
Test Plan:

1.  Start the app (AppTreePanel)
    Show each of the five date-related panels and verify that their dates are the same, 'today'.

2.  Set a known viewed date in the AppTreePanel, then show each panel and verify its shown date.

Not covered here:  Date changes to Panels that are in a tabbed collection.  For those, see the
  workings of the AlteredDateListener.
