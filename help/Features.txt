This is a short list of the top-level features of the Memory Bank application.  Each feature 'name' should lead you
to a more full-fledged document that describes the appearance and expected behaviors.

Archives

NoteGroupPanels:
    GoalGroupPanel
    EventNoteGroupPanel
    DayNoteGroupPanel
    MonthNoteGroupPanel
    YearNoteGroupPanel
    TodoNoteGroupPanel
    SearchResultGroupPanel

    The 'xGroupPanel' classes are the visualization of the NoteGroup classes with the same names (without the 'Panel').


Side-by-side viewing of any two features is now possible via the use of Archives, since the Archive tree provides all
the same options as one would get from the main app tree.
