Use .txt files while in design mode, then can move on to .docs with screenshots, when final.

Only the .txt files should be version-controlled in Git.
  Move all non-txt files out of 'Help'.

For Word, Powerpoint and Excel file types it just confuses the repo and offers nothing that you
  don't also get with DropBox.

A LOT of work is needed in the info here.

For the logDesign.pptx file:
    Separate out Definitions (into a Document?)
    Make a historical screenshots pptx file
    Make a 'current' pptx file (for new screenshots and version templates)
    Update the Hierarchy diagrams, archive the older ones
