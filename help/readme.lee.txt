Use .txt files while in design mode,
  then can move on to .docs with screenshots, when final.  Powerpoint should be for capturing
  screenshots and older designs (for review), versioning, etc - not as a deliverable doc.

Word and Excel files here are not in git.  It might be nice if they were, but for .doc and .xls file types it just
confuses the repo and offers nothing that you don't also get with DropBox.

A LOT of work is needed in the info here.
