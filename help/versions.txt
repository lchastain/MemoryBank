Versions:

The work on Memory Bank started in Dec of 1997, initially as just a 'todo list'.  Earliest dev note in a
    development log is from Jan 1998.  It later evolved into the Personal Log app, and finally to Memory Bank.

Archives of development snapshots are here:

C:\UberArchive\SHEBA\PRESERVED\Archive 2005_0423
    3 snapshots of the todo app development -  todo980202, todo990103, todo991123

C:\UberArchive\SHEBA\PRESERVED\Archive 2007_0325\MyJavaArchives
    19 different versions of todo and log; 8 of them are in .tar files
    There is some overlap of the later ones here with the 39 that are below, but
    the overlap is not all one-way; this indicates that the snapshots came from different systems
    and locations over time, and got collected into archives unevenly.  There is not going to be a
    lot of value added in trying now to deconflict / condense, so will not bother.

C:\UberArchive\SHEBA\PRESERVED\FreeAgent\Log versions
    39 snapshots covering development of the Personal Log app (log) from 2004_0906 up to 2012_0115
    For the ones in the above archive that cover some of this same period but are not here - suspect those
    had been culled from this collection as not-needed dups or near-dups of snapshots that were
    just too close in time.  But as I said above, not going to try and 'fix' anything at this point.

    New repo started when the program was renamed to Memory Bank
    Snapshots from early 2014 development and then the restart in 2019
         Memory Bank 2014_0107 pre-final ver 0.2
            The first 'working' version after settling on the new name and getting it to run from IntelliJ.
            Keep this version because it is the bridge between 'log' and 'Memory Bank'.
         Memory Bank 2014_0109 pre-final ver 0.2
            All renamings of the app, classes and data are complete.  A new help/about graphic has
            been incorporated, and the earlier develop.log history has been cleared, for a 'fresh start' from this
            point onward. If a 'Memory Bank' reset is needed, we can go back to this version.
            First stable version after conversion.
         Memory Bank 2014_0117 pre-final ver 0.2
            Resolved the aggravating duplicate (then lost, when deleting either one) todo item
            problem, then added PLAF selectability and position settability for the pane divider.  Moved
            several classes (especially some serialized ones) to the top level, out from their locations
            as the 2nd+ class in double-duty files.  This eliminates any compile-order requirements.  With
            this version, the swing.properties file is no longer needed; the app can set the L&F for itself.
            Finally, fixed SCR00028 as well.
         Memory Bank 2014_0208 final ver 0.2 (starting with this one, more details below)
            Implemented a TreeBranchEditor class, then integrated it to replace the TodoListManager and moved all
            Todo list operations out of the AppTree and into more appropriate
            classes and source files.  Also added support for logging and much better handling of .ico files.
            Code base has shrunk but hardened, very happy with this version but it now requires some external
            libraries that are for now collected into c:\jars.

         Memory Bank 2019_0916 pre-final ver 0.3 (but still shows 0.2)
            also here: intermediate jar-only snapshots
                mbank_2019_0225 - After the long break, updated to Java 8 and new laptop / paths
                mbank_2019_0829 - Last version before switching to JSON data in files.  Testing had started.

        Memory Bank 2019_1205 - this is the repo for the final v0.3, described below.

        Memory Bank 2020_0206 - this is the repo for a pre-final v0.4, described below.

C:\Dropbox\Memory Bank Archives - Most recent archive snapshots; these may eventually merge in to the above repo.
    Memory Bank 2020_1121 - this is the repo for the final v0.4, described below.
    Memory Bank 2021_0226 - this is the repo for a final v0.5, described below.

Version numbers of the apps were reset back down to 0.2 when the name changed to Memory Bank.
They did not go all the way back down to 0.1 because that was set aside to acknowledge
the growth from the earlier-named apps, primarily the stand-alone ToDo List.

Descriptions of recent versions (find the repo for these in the lists above):
==========================================================================================================
Ver.    Notes

0.2	    08 Feb 2014	TreeBranchEditor for TodoLists.  Stopping point before starting work at CA.
        This version currently being run from \Old Log, as a .jar file.  Full source is in repo.
        Running with a copy of the data from that time; original data is untouched in the repo.
        The long break on development after this snapshot is the reason that it is the 'final'
        one for v0.2

0.3	    05 Dec 2019
        All data now in JSON format
        multiple users
        new Java 8 Date classes
        cut/copy/paste between NoteGroups
        Events is now a Branch
        new menu options 'save' (refresh) and 'undo' for all NoteGroups
        enhanced Branch editor, graphical 'delete' button
        junit 5 testing
        several bug fixes.
        The MAJOR feature work described above is the main reason for declaring this as a new version.

0.4     6 Feb 2020   a pre-final v0.4
        yearview clicks on month & week, and monthview clicks on week (SCR0006)
        Separated View date from Selected date, made the 'Today' action only work on Selection (SCR0106)
        On YearView, removed the YearBox control and improved change mechanisms. (SCR0018)
        Increased Test coverage - now 100% classes, 75% lines (SCR0107, plus many no-SCR changes)
        Load and unload interface changes related to paging
        Menu item enablement tied to NoteGroupPanel changes, moved save to app end (SCR0108)

0.4     21 Nov 2020   final v0.4
        Goals became a branch, vs leaf/placeholder.  Some slightly better work on that UI but yet 'ready'.
        All NoteGroups now have Properties, with an ID
        Restored an ID to NoteData
        Linkages to/from NoteGroups and NoteData, and Reverse linkages
        Hierarchy changes to separate out File operations, in prep for having a DB alternative data accessor
        First data accessor:  NoteGroupFile - for file-based type data accesses
        Reworked the groupFilename settings for consistency and access, now all located in NoteGroupFile
        Added a new debug dialog - 'View current NoteGroup' - allows view of the in-memory data (such as LMD)
        All Panels with a Calendar basis now have more/better date-changing controls (AlterButtons).

0.5     26 Feb 2021   final v0.5
        The 'Found In' link is now fixed for all types, and when using it there is a new menu choice:  'Go Back'.
        Tooltips now stay up much longer, but go away upon typing or invoking the ExtendedNoteComponent editor.
        Now able to set a longer Goal title, and the Goal Plan, via the Title / ExtendedNoteComponent editor.
        The two status settings for Goals is now user-settable, preserved and reloaded.  Goals is now usable.
        Search Panel settings now recallable and shown as Search Criteria, several other Search Issues resolved.
        Archiving is now implemented (for NoteGroups; no plans to do archiving of CNG notes)
        The 'Review' mode is working, for Calendar-based notes
        Run this version with Java 8 and the 2.2.0 versions of the Jackson libraries: core, databind, annotations.



        New version number, not final; this version may 'grow' for some time...
        NOT YET ARCHIVED; this version in dev workspace only.
0.6     28 Aug 2021   a pre-final v0.6
        Upgraded Java from v8 to v16.  New Jackson jars (v2.9.0 for core, databind, annotations) as well.
        Added a 'Log' notegroup, built it in to Goals, in a tabbed-pane.
