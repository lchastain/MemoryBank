Undo all - reload the file.  This is what we have right now.

===============================
On the 'wishlist':

Keep a list/vector of undo-able actions, that can be presented to the user for them to 'undo'.
Keep a separate undo list for each Group.
Clear the undo list when a Group is saved.

An UndoData (interface?) class - Each xData type implements Undo?

Undo will need to tie in with menu management, for enable/disable of the menu items.

Undo something from the middle of the list?  Undo all in reverse, until that one is reached?  or
somehow undo just that one?  If a later action would affect an item that is currently in the
undo list, disable that line item until the later action is first undone.

offer a Redo?   whenever an item is undone, it can go to a redo list.

Undo a link - also undoes the reverse link.

undo a link deletion?
