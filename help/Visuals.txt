List of the various visual components of the Memory Bank app -

The app consists of a menubar over a vertically split pane.  In the left side of the split
    pane is an application navigation tree that controls the content of the right side of
    the split pane as well as the available choices on the menubar.  The navigation tree
    has selectable branches and leaves (nodes) with descriptive names so that user
    selection is intuitive.  A listing of the available nodes is given below, along with
    the descriptions of the associated right-side panels.  Menu options are detailed in
    the Controls document.

Tree Nodes:
==================================================
Upcoming Events - This is a branch of the tree whose leaves correspond to Event Note
    Groups (described further below).  When this branch is selected the right side of the
    pane displays an editor where those groups on the branch may be managed.  This is one
    of three (so far) Branch Editors.  See the Branch Editors info for the full
    explanation of 'managed'.

Tree Branch Views - Currently there are two; Notes and Calendar.  No real functionality here;
    just an additional branch view of that part of the tree, but for behavioral
    consistency there is the action of showing them when the node is selected, vs otherwise
    just leaving the right side on the last selection.  These may eventually become 'editors',
    where visibility and order of the nodes can be controlled, possibly even nesting.

Branch Editors - These allow selection and deselection of the branch content to
    appear in the tree, as well as naming and order.  Associated data files may also be
    deleted.

Tree branches are
    expandable and collapsible, and their state is retained between program runs, as well
    as the last selection that was made.
