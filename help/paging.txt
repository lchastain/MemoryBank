Paging is currently implemented for SearchResults and Todo Lists

Default NoteGroup page size is 40 notes.  Child classes may override this; Todo Lists default page size is 20.

When a NoteGroup that supports paging AND group growth gets to an end-of-page boundary:
    If this happened on page one then the pager control will appear, and stay visible as long as there are
        as many as PAGESIZE notes.
    No new note appears, but pages needed is recalculated, to add one.
    The view remains on the current page.
    Navigation up/down will wrap around and stay on same page.
    If the pager control is used to go to the next page, that new page will be empty except for one
        user-editable line.


When a Todo List ...
    merge

 maybe the above para is not needed - do a test/merge where it grows from one to two pages,
 if all ok then remove.
