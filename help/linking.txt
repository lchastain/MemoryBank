Notes and their Groups can be linked to other Notes and Groups, to show that there is a relationship
  between them.  The 'LinkagesEditorPanel' is the dialog where linkages are created or removed.

The dialog is invoked for a NoteData via its context menu.  For a Group, it comes from the main menu.

When a link is made, a LinkedEntityData is created to hold the relationship.

LinkedEntityData - A single instance of a link to another NoteGroup or NoteData.
    A LinkedEntityData extends BaseData and also has these members:
       targetGroupProperties - (transient) the full properties of the target group
       targetNoteData - (transient) the full target NoteData, or null if the target is the full group
       targetGroupInfo - the base info of the groupProperties
       targetNoteInfo - the base info of the noteData
       linkType - the type of relationship that the source has with the target.
            See the class definition for the list of enumerated values.
    A Vector of LinkedEntityData (named linkTargets) is a class member of both NoteData and NoteGroup.
    When source info is needed during link operations, it will come from the entity that contains the
       linkTargets vector.


<STARTING to reconsider this, at least at the 'Group' level >
SearchResultData will not be linked to any other note or group, because that would make it
  appear as though there are duplicates, when viewing the linkages of the various targets.
  And, a SearchResult has a 'FoundInFile' field that is similar to a LinkData in that it can be
  used to get to the original note, and THAT one can be linked to some other Note or Group.

When editing linkages only the links to the current source will be shown.
  This means that when the edit source is a full group, that group may contain notes that also have links,
    but those links will not be shown/editable.  The linkages of those notes will be separately editable
    when those contained notes (as opposed to the full group) are the defined source for the editor dialog.
  CURRENTLY there is no way to call up the editor for a NoteGroup, but a menubar option should be possible.
  LATER - yet another menubar option for a Group:  Show ALL linkages.  This would not be the editor panel,
    but a new one that would show the group's links, followed by its notes that have links, with those links
    shown below each note.  This is to provide a full view of linkages for a NoteGroup (Goal, most appropriate),
    which could be the best high-level view.

When a link is established it is stored on the source and that source's links may be viewed as needed by calling
  up the editor dialog.  But what if you want to know about what other entities are linked TO an entity?  Since
  the editor dialog only gives the 'FROM' perspective, there would be no way of knowing - EXCEPT that when a link
  is created and put onto a source, a 'reverse' link is also created, and placed onto the target.  Now when that
  target's links are viewed, the relationship will be there, but in either case a link is always FROM the source;
  you don't actually ever get a view of the 'TO' perpective.


Rethinking the FROM/TO solution - what about adding another link member, to indicate if the link is a reverse or not?
Then the interface could present TWO lists, a FROM and a TO list.  Maybe the TO list is not editable?  Maybe show both,
or have a button/view switch?  or ALL?   show direction on each line?   thoughts.....
Save the SAME link in both places, then when editing if sourceInfo not mine, it is a TO link, notecomponent configures differently -
    reverse the type, make non-deletable, etc.
    A delete would have to also work on both locations.



Link Management Operations:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  GoalGroup show links:
    The linkages Vector is scanned for links where this GoalGroup is either the target (common) or
      the source (uncommon).  If the related item is a Calendar type then it will be shown.  Showing
      means either the note text if it is a note, or the Date if it is a Group.  Otherwise the note
      text or Group name will only be shown if the other end of the link is also currently in the app tree.
    The concept of a 'keeper' is not feasible for a GoalGroup, because it does not (directly) load its data
      from a file and it must review the linkages every single time it is shown.  But what about keeping a
      'linkages changed' flag, so that the review is not always needed?  Possible, but then the management
      of that flag becomes more trouble than just re-reviewing an unchanged Vector.  But this idea may be
      revisited, if performance becomes an issue due to excessive growth of the linkages list.  Then again,
      moving to a database could speed the query of goal-related links considerably, and provide yet another
      reason that a keeper would not be needed.

2.  A linked Note is altered, moved, or removed:
    The linkages Vector is updated to reflect the result of the change.  This will be done from
    a view containing the source or if one end of the link is a Goal then a removal could be done from there.
    If the current view was the Goal then the removal will be seen there immediately.  Otherwise there is not
    (currently) any visual indication in a NoteGroup that a link has changed.

3.  After a linked Note has been changed in a group with an 'Undo' menu, and then 'Undo' is selected:
    If it had been removed then the Note will come back but the link will not.  This is acceptable because it
      is in line with the behavior of the new 'remove' menu option for a Group, where if undo is used after a
      removal then the file is restored but not reselected.  Lost links would have to be reestablished manually
      by the user, after the note was restored via an undo.
    If it was a change of text then the link remains in its changed form (that has now been undone), until it
      is displayed.  At display, all links are updated from the source and target, first.  This approach will keep
      it in sync with the note in its current state.

4.  A Group is renamed:
    The GroupProperties list is scanned for the presence of this group's ID, and its entry is updated.
    Not precisely a link operation but listed here because this methodology (along with the GroupProperties list) was
        established while designing the LinkNoteComponent, as an alternative to having the group names in
        all the links, vs just having ther IDs.  The real need is for a database table, where group IDs can be
        quickly looked up to retrieve the group name.  Not needed before now for two reasons - first, the group
        name has been the file name, not stored elsewhere and only used within the group, and second, there was no
        need to get the group name via some other group feature with a unique value, as there is now via the
        LinkedNoteData that has group IDs.

5.  A Group is removed:
    The linkages list is scanned for the presence of this group.  All links containing it are also removed.
    If the removal is undone, links must be restored manually by the user, if so desired.  The GroupProperties list is
    also scanned and the associated entry removed from there, but only after the ability to undo the removal has
    gone away. (HOW?  or - if the removal was done immediately and the undo could check the list for this group and
    restore it also, if needed)

===================================================================================================================


Goal Display of Links - Scan the list of links for the Goal ID
1.  If found, check each one to see if the other end is in a currently showing Group.
    a.  If so - search for the other end in that Group.
        1) If found, update the link with its info, even if no changes had been made.  This is a catch-all.
        2) If not found, just remove it. (this could happen after an addition of a note and linking it, and then an undo)
    b.  If the related group is not showing, verify that it at least exists.
        1) if not then delete this link from the overall list.
            This may be double work, now that there is a GroupProperties list planned.  May not be needed.
        2) if the other group exists then keep this note, but not shown.
            It may eventually be verified (by 2a) if/when the group is again shown.
2.  If not found - you are done.


For the LinkTargetSelectionPanel implementation, click on an expandable - expands if not already,
and puts the title on the right, and issues a 'select a group' message.
Selecting a group then loads it for individual NoteData selection.





Link Viewing -
  The links of an individual NoteData will be shown when the LinkagesEditorPanel for that note is displayed.
  The links of a target NoteGroup will not be shown (except for Goals) - at least not in Link/Goals v1.0
  The links that have been made to a Goal will be shown as its primary data list (the group Vector) rather
    than as an additional popup modal dialog.


    The linkTargetSelectionPanel - will show a list of existing links for the entity, as well as allowing a new selection.
    New selections (link creation) must be made one at a time - this is a limiting factor that helps fight DOS.
        but once the creation becomes a service - need a better limiter than just the UI.

Link Sorting - only done for Links where a Goal is on one end, done from the Goal panel.
    (still working this design, but) - A manual sort, with the effects going directly back to the overall list
    of links.  Other links will just keep their relative positions.  If one todo list item applies to more than
    one goal - no problem; there will be two separate links in that case.   OR -
    Keep a list of linked IDs, in the Goal properties, to use in sorting.  But that list would need more management.
    Also need to decide - new Links come in to the list at the top, or bottom?
    Could the LinkTargetSelectionPanel also allow a manual sort?  Beneficial, but could complicate matters especially if it is
    used to move a link that connects to a Goal that has a different sort order.
    All TBD.
