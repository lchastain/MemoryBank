There can be multiple goals active in the app at any given time.
Goals will be accessible via the tree node 'Goals'

Goal data:
====================================================================
Short name - the filename of the data file, after 'goal_'
Last Mod Date - when text or associated list(s) change
Title Line - single line of text beyond the short name, descriptive of the goal
The plan - shown in a TextArea
    Textual description of what needs to be done.
A series of steps, in the right order if order matters
      A step can be an associated NoteGroup or an item from a NoteGroup.  (except SearchResults)
      A step will have a status


Current status (applies to both the overall plan and single steps)
    Scheduled
        on track, ahead, behind
    stalled
    working
    etc.

ChangeLog    (not sure how to use this, but possibly optional add-in when reviewing Log)
    linkages / unlinkages
    text change
    status change


====================================================================

Associate an entire TodoNoteGroup, or a single todo item
Associate an entire Event category, or a single event
Associate an entire DayNoteGroup, or a single entry
Associate an entire MonthNoteGroup, or a single entry
Associate an entire YearNoteGroup, or a single entry

Linkages should be stored with the goal.  If the goal goes away, no effect on the target.
if a linked list or item goes away - update the goal with the note that it went away.
The update may not happen until the goal checks on the linkage, possibly with an 'update'
button.

during a merge - two identical todo items but one is linked, another is not.
they would have different IDs...

a todo item could be linked to more than one goal

a menu selection called 'filter', which then removes (temporarily, from the app view) all NoteGroups that are not
linked or do not have a linked item.
    selective filter?  or just all on or all off?
        todolists
        events
        daynotes
        monthnotes
        yearnotes
        searchresults??
           For the calendar-based groups, may also need to implement the SCR that asks for 'only notes with data'.
    (during this development, consider whether it is also a good methodology for Subject filtering).

To tie Notes to a goal we finally begin to use the note ID.  A linkage will be the combination of
which notegroup, and the note ID.  If it is to the group itself then the note ID can be null.

Decided NOT to use subjects for goal linkages because they have other uses but we can only have one subject.
  What if a movie you saw (Subject Movies) was also an accomplished step on a Stephen King goal?
  (to see/read ALL SK material) - you could not have two subjects.
