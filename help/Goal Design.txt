Goal data:
====================================================================
Short name - the filename of the data file, after 'goal_'

NoteData, containing:
    ID
    Last Mod Date - when text or associated list(s) change
    noteString - Title Line - single line of text beyond the short name, descriptive of the goal
    extendedNoteString - The plan - textual description of what needs to be done.
    linkages - a list of every other note that is linked to this goal

Current Goal status
    Scheduled
        on track, ahead, behind
        stalled
        working
        waiting
          other?

Percentage complete would be calculated; a static member.

====================================================================
Linkage:
    A link can exist between a Goal and other NoteGroups or NoteData items.  A link can have a status.
    A goal will contain (and display) a list of all its linkages, in the right order if order matters.
    Filters that can be applied to the linkages list:
        ALL
        completed progress/activity     shows your progress so far
        in-progress/next/upcoming/todo  what needs to happen next.

====================================================================

A todo item can be linked to more than one goal

a menu selection called 'filter', which then removes (temporarily, from the app view) all NoteGroups that are not
linked or do not have a linked item.
    selective filter?  or just all on or all off?
        todolists
        events
        daynotes
        monthnotes
        yearnotes
        searchresults??
           For the calendar-based groups, may also need to implement the SCR that asks for 'only notes with data'.
    (during this development, consider whether it is also a good methodology for Subject filtering).

To tie Notes to a goal we finally begin to use the note ID.  A linkage will be the combination of
which notegroup, and the note ID.  If it is to the group itself then the note ID can be null.

==========================================================================================================
Considered and rejected:

1.  Using subjects for linking a NoteData to a Goal -
    Because a NoteData has only one subject.
    What if a movie you saw (Subject Movies) was also an accomplished step on a goal?
    (perhaps a research project, proposed goal/subject 'Research') - you cannot have two subjects.

2.  Keeping a most-recent-first log of user-entered and edited notes on the goal -
    The user would have entry/edit capability already, via linkages from the NoteGroup items.  Better to keep the
        links as shown in the goal as non user-editable.
    As for showing the list - sorting and filtering can be done on the linkages.  The user will still have the
        ability to manually sort them.

3.  Keeping Plan Steps as a discrete, low-level list
    Because discrete steps can be too much like todo list items.  Instead, 'the plan' is only a high-level textual
        statement (extended text), and any step-like todo list items, events, or notes will come into the goal
        via a linkage.

4.  For ease of storage, retrieval and display, limit the number of linkages
    A.  From a single NoteData - Yes.  Will keep this, also to head off possible mal-usage of the link capability.
        Ten is the initial thought; manageable via a popup dialog (JOPtionPane).
    B.  To a Goal  - No.  What if a goal has been long-running over a period of years?  There is no good
        or reasonable value to which a limit should be set.

5.  ChangeLog
        linkages / unlinkages
        text change
        status change
    This would actually apply to ALL NoteGroups, if we would implement it.  But right now it is too big of a task
        to just add in to this one.  Future dev, to apply to ALL groups, IF the user has paid for this add-on
        service.  Otherwise too costly for processing overhead, storage, and would need a paging UI to be able to
        review and search for specific LMDs.




==========================================================================================================
Not yet handled:

During a merge - two identical todo items but one is linked, another is not.
they would have different IDs...

A linked todo item is moved to a DayNote, or copied somewhere.

If the goal goes away...
if a linked list or item goes away - update the goal with the note that it went away.
The update may not happen until the goal checks on the linkage, possibly with an 'update'
button.

Link status choices same as Goal statuses?
