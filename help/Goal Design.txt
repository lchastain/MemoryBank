A Goal will be represented by a GoalGroup; one GoalGroup per Goal.

Goal data:
====================================================================

Short name -
    This will show in the 'Title' area of the GoalGroup.
    Should also be descriptive of the goal, if possible in 1-3 words
    This is not a class member; it is just the filename of the data file
        (after 'goal_' and before '.json')

Properties (an extended NoteData):
    Members inherited from the base NoteData class:
        noteId - The ID of this goal will be present in a Linkage of a NoteData item that points to this goal.
            It will be a UUID and will dereference the name of the goal from its unique identifier, allowing
            for renaming of a Goal while not breaking the linkage of any Note that points to it.
        Last Mod Date - when title, status, or the plan changes
        noteString - Title Line - single line of text beyond the Short name, descriptive of the goal
        extendedNoteString - The plan - textual description of what needs to be done.
        linkages - (remains null)

    New data members:
        Status
            Overall
                on track, ahead, behind
            At the Moment
                stalled
                working
                waiting
                other?

A list of every other note that is linked to this goal, in its Group Vector.
XXX    See GoalGroup Design for more on Vector makeup.

  DataVector (GoalLinkDataVector) a
  OR NOT - seems that NoteGroups are not using the DataVector class.
    which could call for a big rename throughout the NoteData hierarchy. (putting it back to what it was)
    What DOES use that class:  the Search method, in AppTreePanel.

====================================================================
Linkage:
    A link can exist between a Goal and other NoteGroups or NoteData items.  A link can have a status.
    A goal will contain (and display) a list of all its linkages, in the right order if order matters.

====================================================================

A todo item can be linked to more than one goal.

No SearchResult will be linked to a Goal, because a SearchResult has a 'FoundIn' and when you go there you
    have the original note, and THAT one can be linked to a Goal.

A menu selection called 'filter', which then removes (visually, only, from the Goal view) all Notes that are not
        todolists
        events
        daynotes
        monthnotes
        yearnotes
    give it a 'Select All' option, like the one in the Excel data filter.

Filtering may (also or alternatively) take a different approach, based on status.
        completed      shows your progress so far
        in-progress/next/upcoming/todo  what needs to (or will) happen next.


To tie Notes to a goal we finally begin to use the note ID.  A linkage will be the combination of
which notegroup, and the note ID.  If it is to the group itself then the note ID can be null.

==========================================================================================================
Considered and rejected:

1.  Using subjects for linking a NoteData to a Goal -
    Because a NoteData has only one subject.
    What if a movie you saw (Subject Movies) was also an accomplished step on a goal?
    (perhaps a research project, proposed goal/subject 'Research') - you cannot have two subjects.

2.  Keeping a most-recent-first log of user-entered and edited notes on the goal -
    The user would have entry/edit capability already, via linkages from the NoteGroup items.  Better to keep the
        links as shown in the goal as non user-editable.
    As for showing the list - sorting and filtering can be done on the linkages.  The user will still have the
        ability to manually sort them.

3.  Keeping Plan Steps as a discrete, low-level list
    Because discrete steps can be too much like todo list items.  Instead, 'the plan' is only a high-level textual
        statement (extended text), and any step-like todo list items, events, or notes will come into the goal
        via a linkage.

4.  For ease of storage, retrieval and display, limit the number of linkages
    A.  From a single NoteData - Yes.  Will keep this, also to head off possible mal-usage of the link capability.
        Ten is the initial thought; manageable via a popup dialog (JOPtionPane).
    B.  To a Goal  - No.  What if a goal has been long-running over a period of years?  There is no good
        or reasonable value to which a limit should be set.

5.  ChangeLog
        linkages / unlinkages
        text change
        status change
    This would actually apply to ALL NoteGroups, if we would implement it.  But right now it is too big of a task
        to just add in to this one.  Future dev, to apply to ALL groups, IF the user has paid for this add-on
        service.  Otherwise too costly for processing overhead, storage, and would need a paging UI to be able to
        review and search for specific LMDs.

6.  Having a filter that affects other NoteGroups in the app/tree.
    A filter at the app-level, based on a Goal - is not needed, since the Goal itself IS that filter.  Filtering
        may be done within the goal, only, as described above.




==========================================================================================================
Not yet handled:

During a merge - two identical todo items but one is linked, another is not.
they would have different IDs...

A linked todo item is moved to a DayNote, or copied somewhere.

If the goal goes away...
if a linked list or item goes away - update the goal with the note that it went away.
The update may not happen until the goal checks on the linkage, possibly with an 'update'
button.

Link status choices same as Goal statuses?
