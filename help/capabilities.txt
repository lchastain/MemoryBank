List of all supported capabilities of the Memory Bank app -
(format here will almost certainly change; this is just to get us started - 9/8/2019)

Visually, the app is MenuBar over a SplitPane.  The description of menu items will be
    given below, in the areas where they are applicable.  This is because menu choices
    appear conditionally, dependent on actions taken on the control below the bar in the
    left side of the pane.  The left side shows a content navigation tree, with selectable
     nodes that control the content of the right side.  The nodes all have descriptive
     names so that user selection should be intuitive.  Tree branches are expandable and
     collapsible, and their state is retained between program runs, as well as the last
     selection that was made.   Depending on the selected left-side tree node, the right
     side displays several different components, described below.

Tree Branch Editors - These allow selection and deselection of the branch content to
    appear in the tree, as well as naming and order.  Associated data files may also be
    deleted.  Currently there are three supported, for the management of:
        Upcoming Events
        Todo Lists
        Search Results

Tree Branch Views - Currently there are two; Notes and Calendar.  No real functionality here;
    just an additional branch view of that part of the tree, but for behavioral
    consistency there is the action of showing them when the node is selected, vs otherwise
    just leaving the right side on the last selection.  These may eventually become 'editors',
    where visibility and order of the nodes can be controlled, possibly even nesting.

Upcoming Events -

Goals - nothing going on here, yet.

Year View - View a Calendar Year, one year per page, scrollable
    Which year is shown in the UI can be controlled in several ways.  Foremost are the +/- controls,
        for incrementing and decrementing the display by one Year.
    Initial / Current date selection is shown with a red label and bold red highlight of the numeric date.
    A single left-click on a date will select it, changing the choice label and date highlighting.
    A single right-click on a selected date will deselect it.  The choice label goes away.

Month View - View a Calendar Month, one month per page, scrollable
    Which month is shown in the UI can be controlled in several ways.  Foremost are the +/- controls,
        for incrementing and decrementing the display by one Month.

Day Notes   - Make / Edit / Keep time/day based notes, with optional associated icons
    Which day is shown in the UI can be controlled in several ways.  Foremost are the +/- controls,
        for incrementing and decrementing the display by one Day.
    The UI shows up to 40 notes in a day.

Month Notes - Make / Edit / Keep Month based notes

Year Notes  - Make / Edit / Keep Year based notes

Note-based interfaces:
    Day Notes (DayNoteGroup)
    Month Notes (MonthNoteGroup)
    Year Notes (YearNoteGroup)
    Todo Lists (TodoNoteGroup)
    Upcoming Events (EventNoteGroup)
    Search Results (SearchResultGroup)

ToDo Lists  - Make / Edit / Manage multiple named Todo Lists
    A Todo list item may be moved to Today's DayNote (via its contex menu)
    A Todo list item may be assigned a related Date (via a selection on the Group's Three Month Column panel)
    A Todo list item may be moved to the DayNote of its related Date, if it has one  (via its contex menu)
    A Todo list item may be copied or moved to any other NoteGroup type (via its contex menu)

Perform a search of all user data, save resulting list and display
    search can be keyword or date-based
    results file name containing JSON data has the format:  search_<timestamp>.json
    display will show where found
    more than 40 results will be 'paged'
