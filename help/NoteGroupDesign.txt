A NoteGroupPanel extends from a FileGroup.
    both are abstract classes.

Inherited from FileGroup:
    Filename definition & manipulation
    Group 'changed' status
    Load and Save of Object array from/to the data file

Data Members:
    A Vector of NoteData.

All NoteGroups encapsulate a JPanel where their data is presented for view/edit.
  Each group is responsible for building and configuring its own JComponents.

What they do not have is a separate data class that loads into them; as well as
  the 'view', they ARE that data class although it is not all stored in one place.

So when a NoteGroupPanel is 'saved', what is preserved is any group-specific metadata
  in the first position of an Object array, and the Vector is stored separately,
  in the next position.  The 'short' name of the group (used to statically derive
  the data file path/name) is stored in the application options, unless it is a
  calendar-based group where the filename is derived from the Date.
