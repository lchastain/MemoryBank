What user data is persisted?

The main app has options - those are saved automatically at program close.
NoteGroups -  saved on demand if there have been changes, and also at program close.
Subjects
Default Icons
Locations

========================================================================================================

NoteGroups:

Automatically for Calendar Note groups when their viewed date changes (when the alter buttons are used).  This presents a
        disconnect between behaviors with these groups and the way that the others are saved only upon demand
        or program exit.  It raises a question on how to proceed with linkages and reverse links - to autosave,
        or somehow queue up the changes/new links?
  The (current) answer is - go ahead with an autosave for the group getting the new links, as well any/all groups that
    got reverse links as a result.  It does take away the 'undo' option from the user; to be sorted out later.



Defaults for subjects, icons (move these items to Properties?)
    maybe not - these apply to ALL groups in the category.

When a link is created, the source group is saved.
