What happens when...

1.  The tree view moves away from a NoteGroup that has unsaved changes.
    The unloadInterface method is called for it.  Changes go into the group data vector but are not saved, and if/when
      it is shown again, the 'save' and 'undo' menu items will be enabled.  At app end, any remaining unsaved changes
      are saved at that time.
