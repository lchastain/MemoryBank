A Goal will be represented by a GoalGroup; one GoalGroup per Goal.

There can be multiple goals active in the app at any given time.
Goals will be accessible under the expandable tree node 'Goals'
GoalGroup data is described in the GoalGroupData Design.txt document

The Panel  (groupNotesListPanel)
    Inherited from NoteGroup (default Layout manager is BorderLayout)





Percentage complete - a static member, not preserved and held at the group level, only.
    Calculated when needed.

An 'Evaluate' button - ask the computer to give a report on how you are doing and it
    will 'calculate' your overall status.  The user will be able to override this.


=======================================
still thinking on these...

notes, milestones and roadblocks (list)
    items that have been linked to this goal.
    each item also gets a status ?

change log


====================================================================

A menu selection called 'filter', which then removes (visually, only, from the Goal view) all Notes that are not
        todolists
        events
        daynotes
        monthnotes
        yearnotes
    give it a 'Select All' option, like the one in the Excel data filter.

Filtering may (also or alternatively) take a different approach, based on status.
        completed      shows your progress so far
        in-progress/next/upcoming/todo  what needs to (or will) happen next.


To tie Notes to a goal we finally begin to use the note ID.  A linkage will be the combination of
which notegroup, and the note ID.  If it is to the group itself then the note ID can be null.

==========================================================================================================
Considered and rejected:

1.  Using subjects for linking a NoteData to a Goal -
    Because a NoteData has only one subject.
    What if a movie you saw (Subject Movies) was also an accomplished step on a goal?
    (perhaps a research project, proposed goal/subject 'Research') - you cannot have two subjects.

2.  Keeping a most-recent-first log of user-entered and edited notes on the goal -
    The user would have entry/edit capability already, via linkages from the NoteGroup items.  Better to keep the
        links as shown in the goal as non user-editable.
    As for showing the list - sorting and filtering can be done on the linkages.  The user will still have the
        ability to manually sort them.

3.  Keeping Plan Steps as a discrete, low-level list
    Because discrete steps can be too much like todo list items.  Instead, 'the plan' is only a high-level textual
        statement (extended text), and any step-like todo list items, events, or notes will come into the goal
        via a linkage.

4.  For ease of storage, retrieval and display, limit the number of linkages
    A.  From a single NoteData - Yes.  Will keep this, also to head off possible mal-usage of the link capability.
        Ten is the initial thought; manageable via a popup dialog (JOPtionPane).
    B.  To a Goal  - No.  What if a goal has been long-running over a period of years?  There is no good
        or reasonable value to which a limit should be set.

5.  ChangeLog
        linkages / unlinkages
        text change
        status change
    This would actually apply to ALL NoteGroups, if we would implement it.  But right now it is too big of a task
        to just add in to this one.  Future dev, to apply to ALL groups, IF the user has paid for this add-on
        service.  Otherwise too costly for processing overhead, storage, and would need a paging UI to be able to
        review and search for specific LMDs.

6.  Having a filter that affects other NoteGroups in the app/tree.
    A filter at the app-level, based on a Goal - is not needed, since the Goal itself IS that filter.  Filtering
        may be done within the goal, only, as described above.




==========================================================================================================
Not yet handled:

During a merge - two identical todo items but one is linked, another is not.
they would have different IDs...

A linked todo item is moved to a DayNote, or copied somewhere.

If the goal goes away...
if a linked list or item goes away - update the goal with the note that it went away.
The update may not happen until the goal checks on the linkage, possibly with an 'update'
button.

Link status choices same as Goal statuses?
