Removing a SearchResultNode can come from either a SearchResult 'Close' operation, or the selection
of a node that has no corresponding data file.


When viewing the Panel that contains a search result (Found In) - the panel that is invoked shall be
  non-editable, and the menu bar will have a 'Go Back' option, to switch back to the Search Results
  list.  Non-editable because the operation is intended to be a review, not a back door shortcut to
  an editing session.  Too many ways to do the same thing can be confusing for the users; only the
  front-door view of a Note should be editable.
