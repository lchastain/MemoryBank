When there are currently no previous Search Results, the application tree that is generated at startup
  will have no 'Search Results' branch.  The branch is created when the first search result becomes
  available (after a search has been performed).

If all currently existing search results are deleted then the Search Results branch becomes a 'leaf',
  and selection of that leaf will bring up a new search dialog.

Removing a SearchResultNode can come from either a SearchResult 'Close' operation, or the selection
of a node that (somehow) has no corresponding group.


When viewing the Panel that contains a search result (user clicks on the 'Found In' value) - the panel that is
  invoked shall be non-editable, and the menu bar will have a 'Go Back' option, to switch back to the Search Results
  list.  Non-editable because the operation is intended to be a review, not a back door shortcut to
  an editing session (too many ways to do the same thing can be confusing for the users); only the
  front-door view of a Note should be editable.
  Other reasons:  We do not want to allow the impression that changing the source of the result will have
  any effect at all on the SearchResult that it came from, since that result is a snapshot of the note at
  the time the search was conducted; there is no 'live' connection to it.  The Group that is shown may no
  longer have the search result, or the note that it came from may have been altered enough that it no longer
  meets the search criteria.
  If for some reason the entire 'Found In' group is not available, a 'new' one (empty, of course) is constructed
    and displayed.  Not much help but it will have the correct title and no content, to show that the requested
    group is no longer there.  Then the user may use the 'Go Back' menu item, or any other navigation control on
    the app tree.
