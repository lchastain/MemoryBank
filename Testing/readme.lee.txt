Test development to this point (8/2019) has been minimal and sporadic.

What is seen here are a few files files (in both .doc and .txt format) that describe the manual steps to be 
taken in order to test some of the interfaces.  These cannot be accomplished by Unit Tests.

The TreeBranchEditorExample.java file in TestDrivers provides an app that can be used for
testing the TreeBranchEditor.  Instructions
for using it are here in the TreeBranchEditor.txt file.

But now, automated junit tests are being added to the
project.  The goal is to eventually convert everything here over to that type of test, remove the
files and folder here as well as the 'TestDrivers' folder and file, and instead document the new tests
in a more industry-standard way.
