TodoBranchHelper

Run the Memory Bank app.  Test data conditions unknown, tho.


Test:  Sub-branch creation
---------------------------------------------------
1.  Should not be possible.  Drag one list onto another,
    drop there and verify it goes back to original loc.

Test:  Close the editor after 'Apply'
---------------------------------------------------
1.  Click 'Apply', verify that you go to the 'About' view.
2.  This should happen every time 'Apply' is clicked but this is the only time
    it needs verification.

Test:  Branch reordering
---------------------------------------------------
1.  Move one list to another place in the branch.
2.  Click 'Cancel', verify that the list goes back to its original location.
3.  Move it again, this time click 'Apply'.
4.  Verify:  on the left 'tree' view, the list moves to where you placed it.
5.  Recall the branch editor, verify that it starts in the same condition as the
    left side view.
6.  Click Cancel - verify no change (the moved list does not go back to its
    original location).

Test:  File renaming
---------------------------------------------------
    To a deleted list - no, during the same editing session; but yes, after that one was 'Apply'ed.

Test:  File deletion
---------------------------------------------------
    After a rename - the rename occurs first, whether or not delete is agreed to.
        is this ok?  think so but feels wrong.


Test:   Clear Entire List does not remove the list
    The test title is the desired behavior; unlike an empty 'new' list, an empty
    list that has been cleared will still have a file on the filesystem.
    (because of options? - don't know but it is working as desired.)
