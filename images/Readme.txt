The 'about' graphic comes from help\logDesign.ppt - Open it with Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2013

Find the page, update the version number and then save the grouped image as a .gif.
But then you have a gif with a solid background.  To convert it to a transparent background,
open the file with IrfanView and do a Save As...
    You get two popups; the main one has the file location, type and name, the smaller one has gif 
	options.  In the gif options, select 'Save with a transparent color' and select the 
	'Choose color during saving' option.  You can 'save' on the smaller dialog but it just 
	saves those choices, not the file.  So click save on the main dialog and it will ask you 
	to click on the background color and then it will ask to confirm the file overwrite.  Do 
	those and you're done.

about.gif is used by the app directly from here.

Version numbers are described in help\versions.txt
