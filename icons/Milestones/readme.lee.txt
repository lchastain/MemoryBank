The files here are used semi-anonymously, referenced only by their position in a sorted 
string array of their names (except for this one, of course).

So if you intend to add or remove one -

add:  Make sure it goes to the 'end' - give it a name that starts with the next higher 
	numerical prefix.  But keep in mind that these are chosen cyclicly via mouse clicks;
	you don't want the user to have so many choices that they find it all too tedious.

remove:  This is really just not supported well; a removal will change the icon that goes with
	all other notes that had a 'higher' prefix.  Better to replace with a different one.
